Peng Huang is an Assistant Professor of Sociology at the <a href="http://sociology.uga.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Georgia</a>. He received his PhD in Sociology and an MS in Statistics from the <a href="http://www.sociology.uci.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of California, Irvine</a>, trained in the <a href="http://ncasd.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Networks, Computation, and Social Dynamcis Lab</a>. He also holds BAs in Sociology and Economics from Peking University.<br />

Huang's research focuses on social networks and population dynamics, adopting a relational and structural approach to explore social processes and people's experiences therein. His first line of research examines how network dynamics and geopolitical contexts shape migration patterns. He studies the social and political cleavages contributing to the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/00031224231212679" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">population immobility</a> in the United States. Another paper critically engages with the phenomenon known as the "<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/0022250X.2023.2284431" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">California Exodus</a>." Huang's another research program investigates the spatial distribution of social relations. This line of inquiry offers insights into the diffusion of infectious diseases: the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2011656117" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer">spatial pattern of local outbreak</a>, the network mechanism that undermines disease reproduction, and the related <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2121675119" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">health disparity issues</a>. <br />

Huang's methodological work concentrates on developing statistical and computational methods to model network and population structures, dynamically and at a large scale. He studies computational methods that model valued/weighted networks, especially for large networks with high edge variance, under the framework of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2023.07.001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exponential-family random graph models (ERGMs)</a>. Alongside collaborators, he also develops imputation methods and algorithms for cross-tabulation data, which can be applied to infer distributions of multiple demographic characteristics in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/00811750231203218" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">small areal units</a>.<br />

Huang is a recipient of the Geoffrey Tootell Dissertation Award from the Mathematical Sociology Section of the American Sociological Association, and the Best Student Paper Award from the International Network for Social Network Analysis (INSNA).

Broadly interested in social networks and population dynamics, I take a relational and structural approach to studying social processes and people's experience therein. My dissertation examines how network dynamics and geopolitical conditions shape migration. One of the chapters identifies the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02347" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social and political cleavages behind immobility</a> of Americans; another chapter interrogates the phenomenon of "California Exodus." My second line of research studies the spatial distribution of social relations, and its application in understanding the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2011656117" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer">diffusion of infectious diseases</a> such as COVID-19, and the related <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2121675119" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">health disparity issues</a>. <br />

using Markov chain Monte Carlo and loglinear models

My research is driven by interests in general questions about how people get along with each other in various social and geographical spaces: how we connect with our neighbors? what drives people to leave a place, and what holds on them to stay? where are people moving, and how new and old settlers of a place make sense of their relationships?
I enjoy the insights from formal and relational approaches originated in mathematical sociology, which unveils structural forces and related mechanisms that shape people's experience, behaviors, and perceptions. But I am also a fan of methodological pluralism, appreciative of the rich and unique perspectives we gain from examining social phenomenon at different angles.
A statistician by training, I am a methodologist avid for developing analytical tools to study problems that was deterred by a lack of related methods, which is a common challenge for studies of migration and social networks given the difficulty of information access and their interesting data structures. This interest in methodology also encourages me to think critically when evaluating the research process to make sure methods are properly emlpoyed and interpreted. 


I also develop statistical and computational methods. I develop methods and tools to model large, dynamic, valued networks using the [ERGM] framework, by implementing functions of Maximum Pseudo Likelihood Estimation. In another project, we develop methods to input three-way crosstab data using loglinear models and simulated annealing, which could be employed to estimate the interactions among demographic characteristics in different geographic areas. I also write codes under the ergm framework in R to model network patterns, visualize model accuracy, create formatted regression tables, etc. You can sisit the programming section for more information.
I am also implementing codes, as extension of [ergm.count] package in R, for goodness-of-fit diagnosis and modeling of dependence terms.
